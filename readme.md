**About SwiftCart and it's functionality**

This is an HTML and Alpine.js E-commerce store that displays a product list with filtering and sorting options. It uses the Alpine.js library for data binding and the fakestoreapi to fetch data. The page consists of a header, a filter and sort section, a product list, and a modal for displaying product details.

The filter and sort section allows users to filter products by category and sort them by price. The product list displays a list of products with an image, title, category, price, rating, and a button to add to cart. When a user clicks on a product, a modal opens displaying more details about the product.

The JavaScript code in <script> tags initializes the product list, fetches data from the API, and handles filtering, sorting, and modal functionality.
